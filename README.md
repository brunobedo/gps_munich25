# GPS_Munich25

**Data Science and Sports Performance: A Bavarian–Latin American Initiative for Integrating GNSS, LPS, and Computer Vision Tracking in Team Sports Analysis**

This repository documents the collaborative efforts between the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to develop and apply positional data analysis tools in team sports. The project promotes academic exchange, international workshops, and the development of open metrics and visualizations for performance analysis.
