# GPS Analysis | Munich 2025 
## Data Science and Sports Performance:  A Bavarian-Latin American Initiative for Integrating GNSS, LPS, and Computer Vision Tracking in Team Sports Analysis


Collaborative initiative for sports performance analysis using positional tracking data (GNSS, LPS, and Computer Vision) across Brazilian and German institutions. This project promotes scientific exchange, joint workshops, and the development of open tools and resources for applied research in team sports.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains code, data, and documentation from the *Data Science and Sports Performance* project — an international collaboration led by researchers from the University of São Paulo (USP) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The project focuses on the integration and analysis of GNSS-based tracking data in team sports using open-source tools and reproducible methods.
